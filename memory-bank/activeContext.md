# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
- Implementing Node A, Node B, and Node C in a LangGraph structure where Node C checks for PHI
- Testing the workflow with healthcare-related questions
- Preparing demo scenarios

## Recent Changes
- Main workflow implementation completed in main.py
- Added PHI detection logic in Node C
- Set up basic test cases

## Next Steps
- Test with actual healthcare questions
- Refine PHI detection prompts
- Add error handling
- Document test cases

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Using Google's Gemini 1.5 Pro for both generation and PHI detection
- Keeping PHI detection simple for demo purposes
- Planning to add more robust PHI patterns
